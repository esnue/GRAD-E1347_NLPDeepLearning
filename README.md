Different packages are required to run different scripts. Due to GPU constraints, the model was developed in Google Colab. Therefore, we strongly recommend cloning the repository to your local GDrive. 

```
!git clone https://github.com/esnue/ThesisAllocationSystem.git
```
Alternatively, you could open the notebook using the GitHub feature of Google Colab.
