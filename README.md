# Thesis Allocation System for the Hertie School 

This project's goal is to facilitate the matching of thesis supervisors with students based on their thesis proposals. The system will be based on a hierarchical multi-label text classification model (HMTC) to be able to include both interdisciplinary proposals as well as weighted preferences.
