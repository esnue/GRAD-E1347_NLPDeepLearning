        "Using academic papers as train data is an approach that was proposed by the similarly-working [Toronto Matching System](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/documents/tpms.pdf). Instead of matching students to professors, the Toronto Matching Systems assigns Peer-Reviewers based on their academic papers to submitted papers.\n",
        "\n",
        "While thesis proposals tend to be coherent in their structure, academic papers usually have very differing structures, depending on the layout that the publisher demands. Constraining ourselves to few or one particular Journal outlet could have made the cleaning process and possibly the model training easier but would also have considerably reduced the size of the train data. \n",

        "Our multi-label text-classification method is based on Transformers and Pre-Trained Language Models. The Pre-Trained Mode is state-of-art [DistilBert](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108). The Transformers version is [4.4.2](https://huggingface.co/transformers/).\n",

        "We are finetuning a pretrained DistilBERT model for multilabel text classification. This is a very common application of text classification, where a given document can be classified into one or more categories. This approach best mirrors our use case where a thesis proposal could likely be allocated to more than one research area, given the interdisciplinary nature and overlap of research areas between chairs.\n",
